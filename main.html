			<p>Last month our <span id="first-word"></span> took us for a picnic. It was a <span id="second-word"></span> experience. We went to a <span id="third-word"></span> near our school. We were asked to carry some <span id="fourth-word"></span>. Some of us carried <span id="fifth-word"></span>, some carried <span id="sixth-word"></span>, and some carried <span id="seventh-word"></span>. We also took along <span id="eighth-word"></span>, <span id="ninth-word"></span>, and <span id="tenth-word"></span>. I will never forget this picnic, as this was the first time that I went for a picnic with my school friends and had <span id="eleventh-word"></span>.</p>
